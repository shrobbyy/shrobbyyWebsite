            <h1>About me 🫅</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Nico, also known as shrobbyy. I'm a 23-year-old IT enthusiast with a strong</br>
                passion for Linux and free & open-source software.<br>
                I'm currently training to become an IT specialist for system integration.<br>
                My daily setup runs <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> — an <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>-based distribution — together with <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> software.<br>
                I'm also a supporting member of KDE through quarterly donations, as I truly appreciate their work.<br>
                Beyond that, I'm deeply interested in privacy, cybersecurity, game design, and gaming. Gaming and game design take up<br>
                a large part of my free time — especially Minecraft and 1st party Nintendo games.<br>
                At the moment, I'm a game designer at the <a href="https://plantaria.net/">Plantaria.net</a> Minecraft network.
